##  Software engineering lecture in 3rd year of studies
This is the application which I used for assignments.
It is only used for university purposes and does not do anything valuable by itself.

It is small ASP.NET WEB API application with custom.js injected.
Also there is folder for xslt transformations and xsd schema which were requirments for an assignment.
