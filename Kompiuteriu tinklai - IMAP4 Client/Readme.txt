This program is created for "Computer networking" lecture. The focus was to learn IMAPv4 email protocol, see how it works.
It is fully tested only on one server: barsta.vhost.lt (vhost.lt hosting provider) so be ready to see flaws if you'll try to connect anywhere else.

Main functions:
- See all folder with unseen count
- See all mail summaries of the specified folder
- See particular email
- Delete particular email

It could also be used as an external library for getting emails to your project. but again: it has only functions listed above.
