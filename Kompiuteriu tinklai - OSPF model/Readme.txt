This program is created for "Computer networking" lecture. The focus was to learn Open Shortest Path First. 
It is just a model, not a real protocol realization. It uses QuickGraph .net library and static routers and links list.

CAUTION: This program was written so quickly - just to get it working and see live example of ospf. It is very likely that it contains a lot of bugs. 
Take your own risk on using/reading/learning it.
